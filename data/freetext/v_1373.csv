139,It would have been easier to rate the research topics if longer descriptions had been available. 
173,Relationship between Requirements and Testing  Checklists to get good requirements  Economically impacts of different RE Methods
194,1. Each company has some RE processes and people that follow them. The amount of experts is always limited and their time is very valuable.     Most improvements attempts I have seen did not consider ROI and risks of process changes.      2. Considering the way I have received the link to your study I doubt that people that would answer your questionnaire are a statistical representative sample. 
204,Do you involve active practioners of requirements engineering in the studies?
216,Would be interesting to have links to the research referenced by the questions. Some of it sounds interesting and relevant and I'd like to know more.
224,
226,Prioritizing Requirements based on source documented in the Traceability Matrix
262,"supposed there would be an overall agreed knowledge about best practise in requirements engineering, who can companies adopt these knowledge?  Usually nobody wants to spent money for establishing methods and tools.  Often people somehow know, how they should act to get good results, but they fail in convincing their leaders to get the time to change old processes and so they stick to the old fashioned way of quick and dirty processes. you know the story of the woodworker, telling  I don't have time to sharpen the saw, I'm busy sawing! "
306,In the list of topic descriptions it is sometims only one word that has a high impact to decrease the practical relevance. Maybe the results of this study would be diffenent if you reduce the list to  key words. 
320,Not at this time
328,I have worked with many Project Managers who do not understand the importance of Requirements Engineering and that it is required for the entire length of the project. Too many Project Managers are sceptical about the benefits and value of good requirements engineering and see it as an overhead cost to be reduced as soon as possible rather than as an essential foundation process. There needs to be better integration of the Project Management and Engineering disciplines so that both have a solid understanding of the importance of each others essential foundation processes.
342,"Most organisations are moving away from requirements engineering, as the new buzz word, Agile, is now the in thing. User stories are not always clear as they are at a higher level than a requirement will be. The organisaton may believe they are being agile, yet that still seem to be in waterfall, should the project fail they blame the people and not the lack of requirements engineering. I find that projects want to follow to many methodologies, which need not always align, and in doing this they, the focus on project success is lost."
371,"Some quetins were not understandable to me, partly because of typos maybe, of grammar errors:  A method for searching certain classes of potential problems in business process models related to their incompleteness of the ambiguity of their labels.  An experiment with students for investigating reading patterns and learning styles of software requirement inspectors for in order to enhance inspection team outcome.    "
409,no
411,no
416,"I am glad you are doing research in that area. We need to improve RE to make it industrial. Right now, requirements elicitation is more of a craft and art, than science. It makes results unpredictable."
445,Discovery of quality needs must be addressed more specifically
466,The survey missed options for answers such as   Don't understand (the suggested topic)  and  Don't know (the relevance) 
490,how the industry is using agile requirements?  there are many researches about the agile requirements topic?  how the academy are exploring this subject?  are the students prepared enough to work with agile requirements?  which are the main problems of agile requirements and which are the possible ways to fix it or minimize it?
500,Will be interested in giving more inputs if required
512,
515,good practices (try / avoid) concerning project documentation (archived after project) vs. product documentation (kept up-to-date)
544,Kudos for your contribution to the discipline
552,"I consider the one-dimensional evaluation of research results as suboptimal. I classified nearly all research as  ok ,, but for several reasons. Sometimes the investigated problem was interesting, but the research approach was sub-optimal. For other papers I liked the approach but considered the problem to be of less improtance/relevance to me. "
620,no
638,"I struggle to see how RE and business analysis standalone as two seperate disciplines: business analysis is the discipline of developing an understanding of needs and developing solutions to address those needs (defined by requirements); RE seems to be a more narrowly focussed, best described as a set of techniques that ensure requirements are rigorously defined and elaborated.  I can see the value of rigorous RE in safety critical areas and situations where the minimum viable product is close to 100% of the solution, but in my world much of the solutions we define are shaped by emergent understanding/properties established by iteration and learning by doing.  Consequently our requirements are largely scope, vision and high level outcomes; there is little opportunity or value for formally 'engineering' requirements beyond this level of detail."
642,I don't have ireb certifications but I would like to plan it in future.
682,"No, that's enough.   Thank you."
716,The base for good requirement handling is that the persons understand what does the customer / Product owner expected and to what level are these willing to put in Money for. Also to understand how the product expected to work and react in different scenarios.
784,no
792,you do a good job.
930,How to handle regulatory requirements on large infrastructure projects without going way over budget
939,I left some answers blank because there was no entry for  I don't understand this statement well enough to evaluate it. 
944,"Too many year ago i was working in avionics project but i had a little problem with the requirements specification, my coworker suggest to me to make a little report but that specification was wrong, so i decided research some standar to identify the particular elements that must have an specification requirementes, so as to i recomend to use the IEEE's standard, that was a better guidance to achive my objective."
965,No.
995,It would have helped to have your definition of what  requirements  are. People seem to have a lot of different definitions.
