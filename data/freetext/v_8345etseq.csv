2,116,Aligning requirements to regulatory standards is extremely important in many industry. Especially in the case when regulatory standards change. On the other hand establishing and maintaining trace-links is still cumbersume. 
5,152,.
8,94,In order to gain a better understanding from the key stakeholders and their requirements for the software development.  It will ensure the stakeholders requirements are captured and can be followed as a marker for what needs to be produced/developed.
9,110,Ambiguities are a critical source of issues. An automatic double check could help.
10,32,A learning-by-example method is one of the most efficient tools allowing for decreasing the uncertainty in the future.
10,148,"The more we know about a product, the more we can say about it. Existing experience can be taken as basis for a lessons learn and to identify changes that might be introduced in order to better design products in the future and to predict what can happen"
12,71,Benchmarks are the start of everything.
13,27,Because uncertainty is where the trouble begins and the right adaptation strategies can reduce some sources of uncertainty which will always make the system better.
14,141,"These practices and artifacts are essential for our work, and are broadly applicable. Their ubiquity often means they are subject to unstated assumptions of their utility. Understanding how others have used them could provide insights into our own work. "
17,10,"A many more automatical methods shall support and ease the work of RE. Especially for standardised requirements, security, safety, traceability analysis,etc. "
18,92,"the title sounds like advanced  RE  and further problem-solving -> only few articles/literature exist, especially in this combination"
22,28,non-functional reqs have the biggest impact on architecture and may not be left aside 
23,63,Personal experience shows that this exchange is both extremely helpful and rarely implemented systematically.
24,31,"There is a constant need to capture both the articulated requirements from the Users, and to balance against the design by the analyst."
24,55,"in my opinion, testing ist very important and shoulb be consider at the beginning of an study too."
28,22,it will give me good reasones for RE that managers will understand
31,24,Focus and particular attention to critical reqs
31,117,"This problem is not adressed in industry. However, almost everyone faces the problem."
44,102,Understanding the applicability of commonly used techniques in different contexts is always helpful as it sharpens the own perception.
46,70,We are currently in this transition and there are major differences in working with requirements per method. I'd be interested in the results of this study
49,2,"In my experience, framing requirements as a constraint for a creative problem solving process yields better solutions. Any help with establishing and improving such practices will likely help the industry provide better solutions. "
63,111,(Formal) Verification trough models (thus in my opinion: formal) at Runtime can drastically improve RE and SysE
77,97,aren't they connected?
82,66,I'm working in agile development environments. This items affects my work significantly.
82,81,Because of the conflict between complete requirements and fast requirements.
85,135,"We learned in the undergrad classes that the learned techniques are used in high risk software, but I haven't seen how it is used in my day to day work. So, it would be interesting to know."
87,61,this comprises a serious problem in industry today
89,46,The survey would help to identify the types of constraints within a business culture or industry domain that prevent Business Analysts from applying their skills or being respected as peers 
90,96,"A lot of regulations are contradictory, it is good to have an overview for decision making"
91,146,Users are the source of the most significant requirements and easing feedback improves coupling from desire to result.
98,86,relevant in daily project-life
98,126,"It's important to discuss and setup requirements to create the task from them. Once start working, any change becomes two tasks: undo and do."
100,16,Today Risk Assessment is essential for the success of many projects
100,57,"Probably because in my working environment we are aware that we should do more about security but have little experience with it. If a method could help teams with little knowledge and experience in dealing with security, it would be extremely valuable."
100,98,"If such a method does not exist yet, it seems to be important to have it."
103,84,I think it's key to determine and share insight on what are the actual business risks (what is crucial and what is not)
104,44,Requirements are extremely important especially if it  can be considered adaptive or automatic 
105,105,Communication in and between teams are dificult. Think RE have a potentential to help.
105,124,I think that communication in general is a success factor of a project; good communication drives to the right goals.
107,51,I think the result of the study might be worth while looking into and a way to validate (or not validate) common used methods.
124,114,Traceability in safety critical systems is THE important
126,56,dependecy between requirements is always crucial
126,107,Green field happens from time to time; incremental improvements are very common. Change requests occur frequently
128,74,Non-functional requirements do not always get the attention they deserve.  Correlating understanding of non-functional requirements to project success would be of interest. 
130,129,To many goverment project get out of budget and time and in many cases the supplier just want to earn money and not focus on customer needs.
143,140,"Product managers in general and the product owner role in the agile context is misintrerpreted, poorly performed. many times by software managers with no expertice in the specific application domain. "
144,89,because it's essential priorize requirements and verify its impact in the system and how much time will be spend in this new requirement
150,127,"We have a lot of old requirements that we do not know if they are outdated or not. These makes the number of requirements very large, so if we could find out which to update or remove by some automated method, we would gain much."
150,133,codes need keep in same steps with requirement.
161,34,"Even though models are used extensively, most requirements are specified using natural language. The better we become at writing in natural language for specifications, the better outcomes we will achieve."
177,85,very relevant to ensure that eg massive amounts of online feedback is actually processed (and not just ignored or skimmed over)
183,42,Project success is a high-level goal. The assessment of requirements ambiguity to achieve this goal is critical.
184,78,Case studies are critical. Knowledge must be exposed based on Task or Jobs and outcomes and case study is a suitable tool for that purpuose
187,88,Need standardized formats for written communication that both software vendors/developers and business managers can understand
194,4,"This research addresses a very relevant issue for the industry, it may lead to important practical applications. "
198,5,"Systems (including vehicles) are becoming more autonomous and adaptive, and there is a lot to be done here."
200,91,To avoid last minute surprise at end. 
201,118,This is an area and a topic I recognize from my work and the environment I am working in.
215,35,"Terminology is essential for the interpretation of requirements, so a method for extraction of terms would be a great benefit. "
216,153,because it could improve the software design in terms of interoperability
218,72,Improving quality of requirements is fundamental since it will drive the final solution's quality
219,33,it is a great way of tracking customer satisfaction and its impacts
221,43,Helps also to Identify dependent requirements and remove their side effects early in the process
224,26,To translate legal requirements into IT requirements needs a lot of translating effort between specialists; a formalized method would improve RE efficiency
235,59,"In my opinion, despite the efforts for aligning research interest with industrial needs, there is still a significant gap, in many areas, between them, so initiatives of this kind are quite appreciated. "
238,48,Without a traceability stratergy an organisation will not be in a position to implement any project that delivers on their planned stratergy or visions.
242,79,This dilemma occurs constantly in practice: time vs. quality.
242,100,Coincide with my experience where time boundaries badly established due to random priorities is a  unnecessary pressure 
244,65,Demand in growing systems to guarantee traceability 
244,101,we can analyse it.
249,23,um einen sichereen Überblick über die beschriebenen Ablaüfe zu erhalten
258,40,In our classical projects (following the V-model) inconsitence is one of the biggest challanges. Any automatic approch that helps to identify inconsistencys or that completle avoid them is of big interest. 
258,134,runtime system feedback could help anysis system requirement.IT is important to keep them consistent.
262,50,User developer communication is usually very complcated because they come from different domains and focus on different goals and details.
265,122,"Many of the times, conflicted requirements and different interests among stakeholders can lead projects to fail. It would be very important if we could map these questions before."
271,52,"We work with a group of users that differ a lot from each other, so it is important we define requirements based on persona`s and their differences. User experience is becoming more and more one of the highest priorities for our systems. "
272,108,Communication (and so culture) is a key concern in requirements engineering and such a study could help understand interesting aspects in this field
272,128,In my opinion we need to share and exchange more information related to the practices that we have been using in order to increase our performance and maturity level.
278,73,I strongly believe that requirements elicitation should be automated as much as possible to get the process standardized and avoid major mistakes.
281,9,Any missed requirement can cause big harm in this kind of systems. This mens any method that could improve something is important.
284,104,"In recent years, users of systems have diversified. We think that it is necessary to consider various factors such as age, sex, living environment, and other factors that have a great influence on society."
289,125,It's important to understand how they do that currently
289,139,To understand more from the interview also to make sure the interviewee is the right person 
291,151,Because it's still an issue to define  good-enough  quality - especially in agile environments. It might be helpful to have a systematic approach for it.
292,95,It helps to build bridges between business and IT (shared views).
302,15,This is what is all about: increasing quality and satisfy the needs and goals of stakeholder by using professional RE. Excellent specifications are a crucial foundation of nearly every development.
304,90,"It's quite dificult to specify unambiguous, de-idealized, and measurable NFRs. We usualy spend too much time."
306,113,The resources are always limited and it is essential to know which area that needs refactoring.
309,76,companies and businesses still use a high amount of textual documents which can be used for RE purposes
310,6,Seems interesting
315,21,"More and more software is cinnected with others, big projects reuslt and are not easy to define and manage"
315,41,Role of software architect is on one hand very important but often neglected. Improving its visibility and impact is very important
323,80,Will enable upfront proof and a way to measure in practice. Confidence to the team and the client.
324,11,"Misunderstandings and interpretations often lead to requirements defects. This effect could possibly be reduced by such a method. Furthermore, the effort for transformation can be significantly reduced."
327,120,It can antecipate risks in the decision making and eventually avoid to elect unadequate requirements to be implemented
330,37,prioritizing requirements is one of the most challenging tasks for REs 
335,53,"The conflict point is IT security - one party wants simple access, the other party wants to close the door with seven locks."
339,62,Collaborative Requirements Engineering becomes very important as system complexity and multi-disciplinary engineering increases. Communication is essential in this paradigm shift away from isolated Requirements Specification by a few Req Engineers
340,8,This is the future way of development. And there is no process etc. on the market which could solve this topic
342,68,"I feel that risk management is not always systematically performed, and it's results flown into requirements. A more integrated RM/RE approach would be useful to force structured activity performing and automate results conversion to requirements/actions."
344,45,"Writing specs and requirements needs a big amount of time in projects. If you have a good spec at the end why not using the whole spec or parts again in case there is a good approach. Often a good, existing spec is taken, but not according a real concept."
347,47,Unanticipated behaviour can occur very late after the system design it could be useful to identify them well in advance
347,145,"one of the most insidious defects in software is a system being in an illegal state.  hard to find in testing, it tends to appear randomly."
350,13,"SoSs are typically highly complex and without a model-driven process it will be difficult, if not impossible, to provide comprehensive validation"
354,82,I think the significant functional requirements are needed for identifying categories of probing questions.
362,54,Could be a strong boost to ease specification of features
364,17,last word in the descriptioni:  Communication : the most important thing that BAs and PMs do!
364,123,There is a tension between RE rigour and agile; understanding how this might be addressed in practice is critical for the future of RE
370,149,"Visual representation is worth a 1000 words, and nobody wants to read 1000 words. Requirements evolve and this is often missed."
372,12,Provide a lead in architecture definition 
375,93,I think an interview-based study can contribute to understanding about this theme. I believe the method is suitable in this context and can contribute a lot.I performed a qualitative study based on interviews and this study help me in my PhD research.
383,36,Performance ist always a very subjective requirement and thus specification is difficult. Many tools exist to monitor and test performance. However the right method and process to apply are difficult to define. 
383,147,It could help to identify the characteristics of the hardware that it will be necesary to install or test for running the project
384,132,"Next release planning is criticl decision to make, thus, having a rational method to analyse the risks with all stakeholders are always important. "
387,144,Currently we have many projects looking for innovation 
389,58,To avoid rework and not-fit-for-purpose solutions on delivery
392,119,Techniques to better integrate product managers and business stakeholders with agile team dynamics are very much needed.
399,30,The people who pay the bills don't always consider all the impact changes can make. having a way to prove what you are recommending is worth while.
403,75,"Traceability is the base for analysis, prediction,... and a big challenge in many companies. If no traceability, no capacity to take the most of analyzing what is done."
407,7,It is a problem practitioners struggle with
413,20,"Practical problem, where I would love to know the outcome "
415,115,"Use of automation for processing large models really helps practitioners, saving time and allowing them to work more carefully in refinements (rather than on simple issues that would be caught easily by algorithms)"
