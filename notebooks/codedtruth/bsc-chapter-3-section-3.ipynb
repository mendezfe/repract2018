The industry needs a toolbox with techniques and practices that work. It is often about the small things: how to conduct an interview with a customer; where to find raw information (organizational charts, service descriptions, product documentation); how to validate requirements (through documents or through triangulation); how to document the results of a customer meeting (Minutes of Meeting). The industry is completely void when it comes to having a toolbox with techniques and methods such as these. It is too much theory and high-level talk. You have all these techniques in research (this questionnaire, open-ended interviews, structured interviews, observations), but the industry use post-its. '\n",
