13	27	Because uncertainty is where the trouble begins and the right adaptation strategies can reduce some sources of uncertainty which will always make the system better.

18	92	the title sounds like advanced  RE  and further problem-solving -> only few articles/literature exist, especially in this combination

22	28	non-functional reqs have the biggest impact on architecture and may not be left aside 

23	63	Personal experience shows that this exchange is both extremely helpful and rarely implemented systematically.

28	22	it will give me good reasones for RE that managers will understand

128	74	Non-functional requirements do not always get the attention they deserve.  Correlating understanding of non-functional requirements to project success would be of interest. 

184	78	Case studies are critical. Knowledge must be exposed based on Task or Jobs and outcomes and case study is a suitable tool for that purpuose

272	108	Communication (and so culture) is a key concern in requirements engineering and such a study could help understand interesting aspects in this field

4	30	no one cares 'how' you developed, just that you have your specifications. there are also too many personalities that no one would use it anyway

5	35	Document driven approaches are decreasing in relevance. 

20	57	If an analyst can communicate well with domain experts and users, if he can analyze what he heard and organize his own thoughts logically, he can create a domain model. I am not sure I trust an analyst who needs a method to explain him how to do it...

31	7	Assumes that high-level goals and requirements are hierarcical. They are not in practice. They are many-to-many and attempts to make them hierarchical make things worse.

40	135	Traceability is not really important or used in all the companies that I worked at. Also, using a small data set does not sound interesting.

56	9	Most engineers are bad writers but good readers. Most projects use specific wocabulary. Automated analysis would do more harm than good.

58	74	I'm not sure how I would apply this research as I don't understand what the outcome would be.

89	79	As a practioner, I prefer learning about the answers than learning about the problems we all know we have.

125	141	In my experience, most modeling language research never goes beyond the PhD lab. It may be valuable eventually, but this needs application before asserting its utility.

163	15	Too technical, I even do not know what u are talking about. We as REs do not take to hard into consideration what technology to be used nor do we prefer certain tools. As well: we think in requirements and not in solutions

183	146	Fluffy.

219	123	I have no interest in app store feedback.  Seem a very tenious link to RE.

240	61	I can't see the value of such a case study

242	71	Students do not yey have the skills to contribuye meaningfully.

277	45	The easiest answer is, that this doesn't affect my daily business and i'm sure that there are already approaches existing.

287	117	In my opinion, this will not work. Additionally, this leads to promises which will nto be satisfied.

304	41	NFRs are not that important after all and current prosa-based methods are sufficient.  Modeling language for NFRRs is too much!

334	44	These studies already exist

358	42	Traceability is not a high-priority activity in Requirements Engineering.

366	111	Agile approach, I do not see this as applicable (at the moment) in the automotive industry 

375	70	probably because of my own attitude.

380	85	Formal specifications (that I've worked extensively with myself in an industrial context) are usually way too advanced compared to the real-world problems that most product managers struggle with

429	4	The research is too academy oriented, it mixes so many aspects, I doubt that it can lead to practical results, other than the ones that can be obtained in a controlled environment with a very reduced set of requirements.
