In an imaginary survey, respondents are asked to rate produce
and to give reasons for particularly negative ratings.
The algorithm performs coding to enable grouping by characteristic aspects of reasoning.

Original code file:

ProduceID,;lfdn;reasoning;Tag
42,100;"Too healthy; takes hours to prepare; expensive";reason:nothealthy
42,100;"Too healthy; takes hours to prepare; expensive";reason:tooexpensive

Code file after your corrections (you correct one tag and add another tag):

ProduceID,lfdn;reasoning;Tag
42,100;"Too healthy; takes hours to prepare; expensive";reason:toohealthy
42,100;"Too healthy; takes hours to prepare; expensive";reason:toocomplicated
42,100;"Too healthy; takes hours to prepare; expensive";reason:tooexpensive
